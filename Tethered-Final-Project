# Tethered â€“ Final Project

**Tethered** is a conceptual mobile app designed to help couples strengthen their relationships through daily check-ins, shared reflections, and intentional connection. This project was created as a final for a programming fundamentals course, focusing on applying programming concepts to real-world problem solving.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Many couples struggle with maintaining consistent communication, especially when life gets busy. While there are apps for relationship advice and scheduling, few offer a structured, mutual way for partners to emotionally check in with one another each day.

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution
Tethered addresses this need by offering a lightweight, user-friendly app that prompts both partners to complete a brief daily check-in. The app focuses on emotional awareness, mutual understanding, and building habits of intentional conversation.
