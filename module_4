```python
# There is nothing wrong with this code. It should display both a and b as the number 7
a = b = 7
print('a =', a, '\nb =', b)
```

    a = 7 
    b = 7
    


```python
# Read two integers
x = int(input("Enter first integer: "))
y = int(input("Enter second integer: "))

# Using three if-else statements
if x == y:
    print("x and y are equal")
elif x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is greater than y")
```

    Enter first integer:  4
    Enter second integer:  6
    

    x is less than y
    


```python
# Simple medical diagnosis script

# Prompt the user for their problem
input("What is your problem? ")

# Prompt the user if theyâ€™ve had this problem before
response = input("Have you had this problem before (yes or no)? ").strip().lower()

# Based on their response, give a diagnosis
if response == 'yes':
    print("Well, you have it again.")
elif response == 'no':
    print("Well, you have it now.")
else:
    print("Sorry, I didn't understand your response.")
```

    What is your problem?  I have a fever
    Have you had this problem before (yes or no)?  yes
    

    Well, you have it again.
